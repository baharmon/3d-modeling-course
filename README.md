# Landscape Representation: Frank Lloyd Wright's Unbuilt Houses

<p align="center"><img src="images/morris.jpg" height="750"></p>

**Course description** 
This course is an introduction to 3D modeling for landscape architects.
In this course you will develop a solid foundation in 3D modeling
by building a detailed digital model of one of
Frank Lloyd Wright's unbuilt houses and its landscape.
You will learn a range of 3D modeling techniques including
3D drafting, solid modeling, surface modeling,  mesh modeling, and billboards.
You will learn how to digital fabricate physical models
of buildings and landscapes using 3D printing.
You will also learn how to make graphics with
3D rendering and photomontage.
Each week you will spend a day in a workshop
learning new methods
and a day developing your projects.
You will work in small teams and
will present an exhibition and a booklet of your
models and renderings at the end of the course.

**Fieldtrip**
There will be an optional fieldtrip to New York City
to view the Frank Lloyd Wright Collection
at Columbia's Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library
led by Prof. Desmond.
